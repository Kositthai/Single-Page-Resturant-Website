# Single Page Resturant Website
I created this project when I was self-learning HTML and CSS for the first time. My family owns a street food shop in Thailand, and I thought it would be great to have a website to showcase our location, contact information, and other details to potential customers.

# Technologies
* HTML 
* CSS

# Planning 
In the future, I plan to upgrade this website to a full-stack web application using React and Node.js. My goal is to enable the host to easily add food items and details while enhancing the customer's experience with additional features. To achieve this, I aim to incorporate Material-UI or Tailwind CSS as part of my learning process for advanced styling techniques.
